In my last project, I experimented with MongoDB, and in this project I used Appwrite, a self-hosted backend, that increased security, allowed easy creation of a database, and reduced deployment times. I was able to fininish this project in a week. Similar to my Threads Clone, the app features include creating, liking, saving, and searching posts increasing user engagement. As mentioned, this is a prototype and template for my next project, meetcute v2.0, which will be mobile-responsive, available on iOS and Android, and utilize Postgres as its database.',

		desc: 'A portfolio project to hone my skills with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. I challenged myself with MongoDB by creating features that allow users to create, read, edit, and delete posts and comments. This was a fun, small project that allowed me to expand my understanding of modern social media functionalities and become familiar with Clerk, a verified third-party tool that reduced the time it takes to set up authentication, allowing me more time to focus on the core features of the app and increasing its login security. I thoroughly enjoyed creating this app, as it has more features than my previous projects and it showcases my abilities to grow as a developer. However, I did not spend much time with styling and believe the app could use a theme overhaul. In my next project, I plan to transfer these features and expand on them so you can vote on posts, similar to Reddit. In addition, I will be moving to react native and postgres to build exclusively for mobile devices and customize the database/',
